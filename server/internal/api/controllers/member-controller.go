// GET: /
// Retrieve members with optional filtering for pagination or no pagination. Results can be converted to records.
//
//	Admin: Can retrieve all members in the current member and across the member.
//	Employee: Can retrieve all members of the current member.
//	Owner: Can retrieve all members across all owned memberes.
//	Member: Access not allowed, except for members in the current member.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Ensure filtering and pagination are enforced to handle large datasets.
// - Add audit logs for queries to track who accessed member data and when.
// func (c *MemberController) Index(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// PUT: /:id
// Verify member application:
//
//	Admin: Can verify, but must assign an employee.
//	Owner: Can verify, but must assign an employee.
//	Employee: Can verify, but only for applications within their current member.
//	Member: Not allowed.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Add logic to handle reassignment or overriding of employee assignments.
// - Ensure employees cannot verify applications not assigned to them or outside their member.
// - Log verification actions for accountability.
// func (c *MemberController) Show(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// POST: /member-application
// Create a member application:
//
//	Admin: Must assign both a member and a member (uses AdminCreateMemberApplicationRequest).
//	Owner: Must assign a member only (uses OwnerCreateMemberApplicationRequest).
//	Employee: No need to assign; simply create (uses CreateMemberApplicationRequest).
//	Member: Applications must be pending. Members can choose different companies and memberes based on proximity.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Validate proximity logic to ensure it is secure and tamper-proof.
// - Prevent duplicate applications by the same member for the same member or member.
// - Log application submissions for audit purposes.
// func (c *MemberController) Store(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// PUT: /:id
// General Enhancements:
// - Add role-based access control validation for all endpoints to prevent privilege escalation.
// - Implement robust error handling for invalid requests or unauthorized access.
// - Log all actions, including data retrieval, creation, updates, and deletions, for auditing and security purposes.

// GET: /member-applications
// Retrieve members with optional filtering for pagination or no pagination. Results can be converted to records.
//
//	Admin: Can retrieve all member applications across the member.
//	Employee: Can retrieve member applications from their current member only.
//	Owner: Can retrieve all member applications across all their owned memberes.
//	Member: Not allowed.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Enforce pagination and filtering to improve performance on large datasets.
// - Redact sensitive information based on the user's role.
// func (c *MemberController) Update(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// DELETE: /:id
// Delete a member based on role permissions:
//
//	Member: Not allowed.
//	Employee: Can delete members only within their current member.
//	Admin: Fully allowed.
//	Owner: Can delete members only within their owned memberes.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Use soft delete (e.g., marking members as "inactive") instead of permanent deletion.
// - Require additional confirmation for delete actions, such as providing a reason or admin approval.
// - Log all delete actions to track who performed the deletion and why.
// Endpoint: DELETE /api/v1/member/:id
// func (c *MemberController) Destroy(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// Update member details based on role permissions:
//
//	Employee: Cannot edit members but can provide a reset password link.
//	Admin: Cannot edit members but can provide a reset password link.
//	Owner: Cannot edit members but can provide a reset password link.
//	Member: Can edit their own details but not those of others.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Allow admins and owners to update specific non-sensitive fields (e.g., address, contact number) while restricting edits to sensitive data.
// - Implement audit logging for all updates to track changes.
// - Provide clear error messages for unauthorized update attempts.
// func (c *MemberController) Update(ctx *gin.Context) {}
