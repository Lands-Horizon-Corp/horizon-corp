// GET: /
// Retrieve all media files for the logged-in user along with the total size of all media files.
// Supports filtering with or without pagination. Results can be converted to records.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Apply pagination and filtering to prevent performance bottlenecks when handling large datasets.
// - Implement audit logging to track media file access (e.g., who accessed which files and when).
// - Include metadata in the response (e.g., upload date, file type, size, download count) for better usability.
// - Add support for sorting (e.g., by file name, upload date, or size) to enhance user experience.
// Endpoint: GET /api/v1/branch
func (c *MediaController) Index(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// GET: /:id
// Retrieve a specific media file by its ID.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Validate user permissions to ensure the requester is authorized to access the specific media file.
// - Include detailed metadata in the response (e.g., file size, type, upload date, download count).
// - Log access attempts for the media file to ensure auditability.
// - Handle edge cases, such as file not found or unauthorized access, with clear error messages.
func (c *MediaController) Show(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// POST: /upload
// Upload a new media file.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Validate file type and size to ensure compliance with application policies.
// - Implement virus scanning to enhance security for uploaded files.
// - Provide progress feedback for large file uploads.
// - Log all file uploads with metadata (e.g., file name, size, and user who uploaded).
// - Store files securely, such as in a cloud storage solution, with proper access controls.
// - Enforce rate limiting to prevent abuse of the upload endpoint.

func (c *MediaController) Store(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// PUT: /:id
// Update the name and description of a media file.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Validate that the logged-in user owns the file before allowing updates.
// - Log all updates with details such as who made the changes and what was updated.
// - Ensure atomic updates to avoid partial updates in case of errors.
// - Provide detailed error messages for invalid or unauthorized updates.
// - Add support for versioning metadata updates to allow rollback or tracking of changes.
func (c *MediaController) Update(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// DELETE: /:id
// Delete a specific media file by its ID, only if it belongs to the logged-in user.
//
// Enhancements:
// - Implement a soft delete mechanism, marking the file as "deleted" while allowing recovery if accidental.
// - Log all delete actions with details such as who deleted the file and when.
// - Validate file ownership before allowing deletion to prevent unauthorized actions.
// - Provide clear error messages for failed deletions (e.g., file not found, unauthorized).
// - Consider adding admin-level functionality to restore soft-deleted files if necessary.
func (c *MediaController) Destroy(ctx *gin.Context) {}

// GET: /team
// Retrieve media files based on user role:
//
//	Member: Access not allowed.
//	Admin: Can retrieve all media files, including those uploaded by branches, owners, employees, and members.
//	Owner: Can retrieve all media files from their owned branches, employees, and members.
//	Employee: Can retrieve all media files uploaded by employees and members within their branch.
//
// Supports filtering with or without pagination. Results can be converted to records.
// Enhancements:
// - Enforce role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access.
// - Apply pagination and filtering to manage large datasets efficiently.
// - Add sorting capabilities (e.g., by upload date, size, or name) for better usability.
// - Implement audit logging to track who accessed media files and under what context.
// - Ensure sensitive data is excluded from the response based on role-specific access.
