//
// Enhancements:
// - Validate user permissions to ensure the requester is authorized to access the specific media file.
// - Include detailed metadata in the response (e.g., file size, type, upload date, download count).
// - Log access attempts for the media file to ensure auditability.

//
// Enhancements:
// - Enforce role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access.

// - Validate file ownership before allowing deletion to prevent unauthorized actions.
// - Provide clear error messages for failed deletions (e.g., file not found, unauthorized).
